	<p style="font-weight: 400;">The back and forth between school administrations and students has been underway for the entirety of the 21st century, with developments in the past couple years drastically altering the playing field.  Currently, student worker unions are either close to, or already have, solidified power in the form of a successfully negotiated contact.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The this iteration of student worker unionization is certainly not the first of its kind, and to understand it fully, it’s useful to look at the last push.  There was large effort in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/16/us/labor-board-says-graduate-students-private-universities-have-no-right-unionize.html">2000</a>, where grad students at NYU tried to form a union, and the school administration took it to the National Labor Relations Board, or NLRB.  The NLRB is the federal agency responsible for enforcing labor law, with a focus on unfair labor practices and collective bargaining rights.  The NLRB only has jurisdiction over private universities, public universities are governed by state laws, and many have collective bargaining protections in writing.  The NLRB however, has been inconsistent. In 2000, in response to NYU, they ruled that student workers had the right to unionize, and the school must negotiate with them.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">This changed in 2004.  A similar situation unfolded at Brown University, where the school brought the case to the NLRB, arguing that student workers were not eligible for legal employee protections.  This time, the NLRB agreed, and ruled students at private universities had no collective bargaining rights. </p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">This was the legal and societal precedent for almost 10 years.  Some small unionization efforts at schools started, but most were easily crushed or disbanded with no legal protections.  The exception however, was NYU.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The union at NYU had persisted and in 2013, the school administration made the historic decision to recognize and negotiate with the union, despite not being legally compelled to.  Inspired by this decision, students in two other New York City schools pushed for recognition. </p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">In late 2014 students at The New School formed SENS-UAW, Student Employees at The New School, and in early 2015 students at Columbia formed CWC-UAW, Graduate Workers of Columbia.  Both were formed as local chapters of the United Automobile Workers (UAW), one of the largest labor unions in the country. </p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of following the precedent of NYU, The New School took the case to the NLRB, who again upheld the 2004 decision disallowing bargaining rights, effectively stifling both efforts.  </p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">With help from the UAW, the students continued the legal battle, and in May of 2017 the NLRB reversed its decision and allowed student worker unions to form.  </p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">At both schools the Unions sprang back to life, organizing quickly to officially vote to unionize.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">After votes at both schools were effective, however, both schools effectively refused to negotiate or respect the formation of the new unions.  </p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the end of the spring semester of 2018, the SENS and GWC each independently voted to strike.  Colleen Baublitz is a 3rd year Grad student and organizer for the GWC, who got involved in late 2016.  She helped plan the spring strike at Columbia and found the strike extremely effective: The union voted 92% in favor of the strike, they received broad support from Unions in the city, and most importantly, they showed Columbia that they could and would effectively strike.  According to Baublitz, the union did not expect the strike to be the last, and were ready and able for continued and sustained resistance. Baublitz described the relationship with the administration as “fighting tooth and nail” at every junction. </p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">This continued until late 2018 where threats of a second strike at the end of the fall semester led both schools to the negotiating table.  At The New School, it came down to the wire. Throughout the fall SENS- were negotiating with the New School, but were getting almost nowhere.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The union was set to strike indefinitely, starting on November 26t.  On November 16th, the Union shared they were making progress but it was slow, and the threat of a strike was drawing ever-closer.  In an update to members they said: “We remain hopeful that we can settle a fair contract with the administration before November 26th. We remain committed to a maximally disruptive strike if we cannot.”  On the 20th, the last bargaining session scheduled before the strike, the school relented and agreed to a tentative framework for a contract with the union. The committee representing SENS in the negotiations “ unanimously and enthusiastically” endorsed and recommended the contract, and after a five day long vote ending on December 3rd, the union voted about 89% in favor, and ratified the contract.  </p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">At columbia the school administration was, for most of the fall semester, largely refusing to negotiate with the GWC.  This was only broken by the threat of a strike on November 30th, which brought the school administration to the table to agree to a contract negotiation framework.  This framework was approved by a vote of 1,035 to 720 by the Union members. With the passing of the framework, the GWC called off the strike. “It remains to be seen whether or not they will follow through though,” said Baublitz. </p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The strikes seem to be where most of the real power of these unions comes from.  It was the strikes that brought both school administrations to the table. The capacity to strike has also been a controversial point in the negotiations, with both The New School and Columbia insisting on language in the contracts curtailing the ability to strike.  Section B of the “NO STRIKE NO LOCKOUT” clause, The New School mandated that the Union not only give up it’s striking rights, but actively interfere or report any students organizing any “strike, sympathy strike, sit-down, slow-down or work stoppage.”</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The ripple effect of these two unions’ success reaches far past New York.  Student labor unions are making headway at many large Universities: <a href="https://www.georgetown.edu/gradunion">Georgetown</a>, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/06/22/brown-agrees-grad-union-election-terms">Brown</a>, <a href="http://harvardgradunion.org">Harvard</a>, <a href="https://www.necn.com/news/business/Tufts-University-Dining-Hall-Workers-Decide-to-Join-Union-478735633.html">Tufts</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BrandeisGradUnion/">Brandeis</a> are in the process of negotiating contracts. </p>
