                        <p>California is now the first state in the country to enact anti ‘puppy-mill’ legislation.</p>
                    
                        <p>On Friday, October 13, 2017, then-governor Jerry Brown signed California AB-485 into law. Effective January 1, 2019, the sale of dogs, cats, and rabbits by pet stores in the state is limited to animals from rescue shelters, as opposed to breeders. The goal of the legislation is to fight so-called ‘<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/the-dog-factory-inside-the-sickening-world-of-puppy-mills-112161/">puppy mills</a>’ where animals are mass produced in poor conditions and sold to pet shops.

                        <p><a href="https://bestfriends.org/resources/jurisdictions-retail-pet-sale-bans">Many cities</a> have passed retail-sale bans including Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Long Beach. Until now, no statewide ban has been in effect.</p>
                    
                    <p class="caption"><iframe src='https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1RZFc9QY--Znr2qacn6Pix6bvEnfR_RBpU4LyplmxHCM&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=400' width='100%' height='400' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen frameborder='0'></iframe>Timeline of selected local and state laws, as indexed by nonprofit group <a href="https://bestfriends.org/resources/jurisdictions-retail-pet-sale-bans">Best Friends</a>.
                    </p>
                        <p>According to the state Assembly’s <a href="https://a45.asmdc.org/sites/a45.asmdc.org/files/AB485FactSheet.pdf">fact sheet</a>, by April 20, 2017, groups supporting the bill outnumbered opponents nearly 5 to 1. Included in the supporters were PETA, the California Animal Control Directors Association, and the City of Long Beach, while the opposition came from groups including the American Kennel Club and the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council.</p>
                    
                        <p>Doug Smith, a veterinary assistant in California, was cautiously optimistic about the law. He said “The intentions are good, puppies who come from puppy mills are often physically or mentally scarred for life.” He was worried, though, about a loophole for ‘backyard breeders.’</p>
                    
                        <p>Smith said: “In my time as a veterinary assistant, I have seen many instances where irresponsible backyard breeding could lead to medical problems. For example, part of a veterinarian's job when presented with a new patient is to gather a detailed medical history. I've seen a lot of owners who bought animals from individual breeders and were told that the animal ‘has had all of its shots’, but the animal was too young for that to be the case.”</p>
                    
                        <p>Gwyn Donohue of the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council described the bill as “well intentioned but misguided.” She said the bill could end up harming businesses by “forcing pet stores to sell rescues, but not forcing rescue shelters to work with pet stores.” She also was concerned about a loss of consumer protections. According to Donohue, pet stores are required to use approved breeders and show the pet’s medical history and lineage, while rescues often don't have all the information on the pet.</p>
                    
                        <p>However, Michelle Robertson-Clark, who runs the non-profit pet store The Rescued Pup in Ramona, California, was skeptical of this argument. Robertson-Clark has been working in dog adoption since 2013 and remembers seeing mall pet stores that were selling ‘rescues’ that were purebred puppies, something she has never seen in a rescue in her years working in the field. She suspects the stores were lying about the dogs being rescued, and guessed they may have been from a puppy mill.</p>
                    
                        <p>In her experience many pet stores lie on forms to evade FDA regulations, and the customer experience is often much worse than adopting a rescue. Pet store pets sometimes have diseases or health problems, and pet store service is often very poor. “Pet stores don't really stand behind their product,” she said.</p>
                    
                        <p>Robertson-Clark’s solution? Start her own dog rescue.</p>
                    
                        <p>Robertson-Clark started her first Rescued Pup location in 2013, which was open until veterinary expenses put her out of business in 2015. After that, she ran a small adoption operation out of her home. She was on mailing lists for shelters and described seeing “lists from kill shelters of dogs who weren't getting to homes. I remember thinking we just we weren't saving enough dogs.”</p>
                    
                        <p>Knowing the landscape was about to change with AB-485 coming into force, in October 2018 she restarted the Rescued Pup in a new location.</p>
                    
                        <p>“Rent is do-able” she said, citing service dog training and grooming as revenue sources that help her stay afloat. “It feels like a community project” she said, “the community has been very supportive, with people donating time and resources.”</p>

                    Service dog assisting owner through the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art Saturday, Jan. 12 2019. (Quinn Kowitt)</p>
                    
                        <p>She also said she can offer better service than many of the pet stores. Robertson-Clark said she can be sure of her pet’s health because she actually gives many the shots they need and medical checkups before they go to a home, and if any health problems come up, she is always willing to work with the pet owners to help the pet.</p>
                    
                        <p>The new laws don't seem to be affecting private breeders negatively. Breeder Kristin Hotti of San Carlos, California, said the new laws shouldn't really affect responsible buyers and sellers. “Responsible buyers don't buy from pet shops” she said, adding that responsible breeders aren't exactly hurting. “I can't advertise online,” Hotti said, “because I won't be able to get off the phone.” According to Hotti the demand for her dogs may increase with the pet store ban, which she thinks is a positive for both the pet and the owner. </p>
                    
                        <p>While Donohue and others believe the impact of the law will not be fully realized for months, it hasn't stopped other states from introducing similar legislation. Maryland recently passed a bill going into effect in 2020. New York State Senator Michael Gianaris introduced <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/michael-gianaris/sen-gianaris-introduces-legislation-ban-profit-pet-sales">S7711</a>, which aims to enact similar bans on pet sales, showing the ripple effect from California’s new law may reach far from Sacramento.</p>
